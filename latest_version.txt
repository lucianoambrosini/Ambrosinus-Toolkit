CHANGELOG
v1.2.0
-1 "SDopts_loc" has been added in the AI sub-category. This component allows the user to set a custom Stable Diffusion model checkpoint, for instance, using the “mdjrny-v4.safetensors” model, a dataset trained with Midjourney version 4 images;
-2 "SD-Imginfo" allows the user to read all AI-Gen settings used for image generation;
-3 All C# components have been updated with a new right-click context menu to get more info;
-4 AI subcategory components disposition has been reordered;

v1.1.9
-1 "AIeNG_loc" has been added in the AI sub-category. This component lays the foundations for future adaptations, expansions and tools to make the most of the best features provided by the AUTOMATIC1111 project - It is part of the "_loc" components able to run Stable Diffusion and ControlNET neural network locally;
-2 "LaunchSD_loc" has been added in the AI sub-category. This component can open and close the localhost port and also check the status - It is part of the "_loc" components able to run Stable Diffusion and ControlNET neural network locally (thanks to Automatic1111 project);
-3 "LA_DPTto3D_b101" has been added in the AI sub-category (downloadable from GitHib page). This component can generate a PointCloud (stored in th PLY file format) directly from a 2D RGB image. It exploits the DPT technology (transformers libraries). Right click on the component for more info;

v1.1.8
-1 "FileNamer" component has been fixed; these updates (v1.1.7/v1.1.8) were necessary due to a couple of incoming research projects;
-2 "La_GrayGaussMask" has been updated. Some minor fix;
-3 "LA_OpenAI-GH_Ask_b107" has been updated. Some minor fix;
-4 "LA_OpenAI-GHadv_b112" has been updated. Some minor fix;
-5 "LA_StabilityAI-GH_b108" has been updated. Some minor fix;

v1.1.7
-1 "SeeOut" component has been fixed to avoid a loop-action if its output is passed as input in OpenAI or StabilityAI component. Now it is not necessary rename the Slider Number with the name "SeqID";

v1.1.6
-1 Ambrosinus-Toolkit updated with the "SeeOut" component in the Image sub-category. It can slide the image file path Output by a "SeqID" slider or just see the latest file path generated from OpenAI or StabilityAI GH component;
-2 Minor fix for LA_StabilityAI-GH component, now at Build-107, see the GitHub page to download it. If you already downloaded this build on 2023/02/06, please do it again.
-3 Minor fix for LA_OpenAI-GH component, now at Build-111; see the GitHub page to download it;
-4 Minor fix for LA_OpenAI_Ask-GH component, now at Build-106; see the GitHub page to download it;

v1.1.5
-1 Ambrosinus-Toolkit updated with "FileNamer" component. It can generate a filename to avoid overwriting action;
-2 New version of the "SdINinfo" component. Now able to show different info from StabilityAI image output like BaseIMG and MaskIMG info/links;
-3 "LA_StabilityAI-GH" now is advanced, which means that is possible to run: TXT2IMG, IMG2IMG and IMG2IMG Masking features. I added CLIP guidance too in order to drive the image generation process;
-4 All images will be stored in IMGs folder. All metadata will be stored in TXTs folder. Each run will be tracked in a unique CSV file. Helpful for data storytelling;

v1.1.4
-1 "LA_StabilityAI-GH" build-102 has been updated. After the StabilityAI updates of the "stability-sdk" Python library to v0.3.0, this component you can now select different Engine (Stable Diffusion v1, v1.5, v2.0 and v2.1) and among 10 different samplers; I have modified the filename layout for integrating "SD-INinfo" actions;
-2 "SD-INinfo" component has been developed and added. This component allows the user to grab settings info from the filename of the image generated by LA_StabilityAI-GH component;
-3 fixed minor bugs and inaccuracies in descriptions and names;

v1.1.3
-1 "AnsToPrompt" has been added. This component converts the AskToOpenAI answer into a text prompt;
-2 "AskToOpenAI" component has been developed and added (see GitHub page to install it) to play with OpenAI completion mode, the OpenAI GPT-3 model transforms this component into a super smart "chatBot". I asked for design tips but also for generating a simple piece of code (Python, C# etc.);

v1.1.2
-1 Subcategory Layout has changed;
-1 "DALLEfromGH" UI updated with "Light version" info;
-2 "LA_OpenAI_GHadv" has replaced the CPython "Light version". Now you can experiment with the EDIT and VARIATION modes. You can install it via the GitHub repo;
-3 Subcategory Image has been added;
-4 "ImageConv" can read image file info and can convert images to these formats: Bmp, Emf, Exif, Gif, Icon, Jpeg, MemoryBmp, Png, Tiff, Wmf;
-5 "ImageMask" can generate PNG and JPG image masks by simply drawing them inside Rhino over the BaseIMG;

v1.1.1
-1 "DALLEfromGH" has been added to the toolkit. In order to run it the Toolkit uses the Json DLL library provided in the installation ZIP file. Now you can explore OpenAI (DALL-E) prompt-to-image requesting process directly inside GH. No Python libraries need to be installed to run OpenAI. It has replaced the LA_OpenAI-GH.ghuser component (anyway it will always be available on GitHub and you can always install it by following the guide.

v1.1.0 
-1 "GradientGen" has been replaced by Ambrosinus-Toolkit project;
-2 "ToolkitVersion" component - Now the toolkit can show the version and the main changelog (main updates) and above all notify user if he needs to install the latest version;
-3 "HEXtoRGB" now can be covert also from RGB to HEX values with lowercase and hashtag options;
-4 "KelvinToRGB" converts a Kelvin temperature to RGB value (for specific values shows some extra info about devices that emit the same temperature);
-5 "WavelengthToRGB" converts a Wavelength in a visible light range (380nm-780nm) to RGB value;

v1.0.0
-1 "GradientGen and Utilities", an internal module part of Ambrosinus-Toolkit project;
