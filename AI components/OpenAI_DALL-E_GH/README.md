### LA_OpenAI-GH.ghuser "Light version" component (v1) has been replaced with LA_OpenAI-GHadv.ghuser both of them has been coded in CPython

LA_OpenAI-GH.ghuser "Light version" component is also replaced with "DALLEfromGH" [Ambrosinus-Toolkit since v1.1.1] and it has been coded in C# language, so to run the "Light version" now you don't need anymore installing Python libraries. Anyway, in order to run the "Advanced version" you still need the python libraries as described here.

_I suggest always updating your Ambrosinus-Toolkit plugin to the latest version as a good practice_
