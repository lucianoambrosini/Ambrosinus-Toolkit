### LA_OpenAI-GHadv.ghuser "Advanced version" component Build 112

If you don't want to install python libraries, you can install Ambrosinus-Toolkit and run the "DALLEfromGH" component [since v1.1.1] it is the same "Light version" but coded in C# language. Anyway, if you want to run the "Advanced version" you still need to install the python libray ([as described here](https://bit.ly/OpenAI-insideGrasshopper)) in order to explore EDIT and VARIATION mode. This because of LA_OpenAI-GHadv.ghuser component has been coded in CPython.

Since **LA_OpenAI-GH.ghuser** version: **build-110** output files are packed in an IMGs folder (all images), TXTs folder (all text prompts) and finally this build creates a CSV file as LOG output of all the AI requests and generation processes.
<br>
<br>
Since **LA_OpenAI-GH.ghuser** version: **build-107** (see the build number in the component description) - solved issues about the image saving process.

<br>
<br>


_I suggest always updating your Ambrosinus-Toolkit plugin to the latest version as good practice_
