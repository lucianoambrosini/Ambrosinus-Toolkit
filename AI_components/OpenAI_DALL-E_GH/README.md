### LA_OpenAI-GH.ghuser "Light version" component (v1) has been replaced with LA_OpenAI-GHadv.ghuser "Advanced version" component (v2)

If you don't want to install python libraries, you can install Ambrosinus-Toolkit and run the "DALLEfromGH" component [since v1.1.1] it is the same "Light version" but coded in C# language. Anyway, if you want to run the "Advanced version" you still need to install the python libray ([as described here](https://bit.ly/OpenAI-insideGrasshopper)) in order to explore EDIT and VARIATION mode. This because of LA_OpenAI-GHadv.ghuser component has been coded in CPython.

Current **LA_OpenAI-GH.ghuser** version: **build-102** (see the build number in the component description)

_I suggest always updating your Ambrosinus-Toolkit plugin to the latest version as good practice_
