## AI as rendering engine (Stable Diffusion and ControlNET neural network run locally)

ðŸ†• âœ…**Ambrosinus-Toolkit v1.3.2 is out!**<br>
All the Grasshopper demo files have been updated to the latest ATk version with all new Stable SDiffusion Annotators, Preprocess models and Samplers.<br>

> [!NOTE]
>- [x] With this release most of the main StableDiffusion (WebUI) features have been added to the single ControlNET unit procedures, so enjoy them!
>- [x] first multi ControlNET units componments are in WIP mode, it is more likely I will improve them in the next ATk version, but for now you are able to execute the "transferring style" procedure... stay tuned!

## Requirements

In order to run AIeNG_loc and LaunchSD_loc components the designer needs to install previously the AUTOMATIC11 and ControlNET project on his machine. There are a lot of guides about how to, anyway the simple procedure has been described in [my article](https://bit.ly/SDandCNinsideGH), please have a look to it before starting.

### After the installation download at least one of the pre-trained datasets by [lllyasviel](https://github.com/lllyasviel) 

Again see my [official article](https://bit.ly/SDandCNinsideGH) where I have included all the datasets and the instructions.

**Enjoy your design exploration!** ðŸ˜‰
