### AI as rendering engine (Stable Diffusion and ControlNET neural network run locally)
**Since Ambrosinus-Toolkit v1.1.9**
These are a set of components under development and are able to run SD and CN locally. The first two components developed are *LaunchSD_loc* and *AIeNG_loc*.

‚ö†Ô∏è**Important Run Rhino as Administrator!** *Each session needs to run firstly the LAunchSD_loc component to establish a live connection between the Stable Diffusion engine and the Grasshopper components.*

## Requirements

In order to run AIeNG_loc and LaunchSD_loc components the designer needs to install previously the AUTOMATIC11 and ControlNET project on his machine. There are a lot of guides about how to, anyway the simple procedure has been described in [my article](https://bit.ly/SDandCNinsideGH), please have a look to it before starting.

### After the installation download at least one of the pre-trained datasets by [lllyasviel](https://github.com/lllyasviel) 

Again see my [official article](https://bit.ly/SDandCNinsideGH) where I have included all the datasets and the instructions.

**Enjoy your design exploration!** üòâ
