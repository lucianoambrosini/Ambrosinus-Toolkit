# AUTOMATIC1111 has been update so ControlNET may not works properly (I am working to update this component)
üì£ ControlNET has been updated to version 1.1 but AUTOMATIC1111 API support is not yet implemented. If you want to use this Grasshopper component, please be sure to install [the ControlNET v1.0 version as explained here](https://github.com/lllyasviel/webui-controlnet-v1-archived).

### AI as rendering engine (Stable Diffusion and ControlNET neural network run locally)
**Since Ambrosinus-Toolkit v1.1.9**
These are a set of components under development and are able to run SD and CN locally. The first two components developed are *LaunchSD_loc* and *AIeNG_loc*.

**Since Ambrosinus-Toolkit v1.2.2**
Now it is possible to run Stable Diffusion on your LAN, please [for more info have a look here](https://bit.ly/SDandCNinsideGH-Upd3) üòâ

‚ö†Ô∏è**Important Run Rhino as Administrator!** *Each session needs to run firstly the LAunchSD_loc component to establish a live connection between the Stable Diffusion engine and the Grasshopper components.*

## Requirements

In order to run AIeNG_loc and LaunchSD_loc components the designer needs to install previously the AUTOMATIC11 and ControlNET project on his machine. There are a lot of guides about how to, anyway the simple procedure has been described in [my article](https://bit.ly/SDandCNinsideGH), please have a look to it before starting.

### After the installation download at least one of the pre-trained datasets by [lllyasviel](https://github.com/lllyasviel) 

Again see my [official article](https://bit.ly/SDandCNinsideGH) where I have included all the datasets and the instructions.

**Enjoy your design exploration!** üòâ
