### MeshyReq and MeshyRet components Build 101

As many already know, new platforms and services dedicated to AI are growing visibly. Meshy is one of them and promises to empower content creators to effortlessly turn text and images into captivating 3D assets in under a minute. Waiting for further developments... I'm starting to integrate these features within Ambrosinus Toolkit v1.2.6 ðŸ˜‰ these components have been coded in CPython.
